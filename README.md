##Project Proposal

#Audience: 
All cookers who search recipes.

#Problem being solved:
Easy finding of new recipes.

Conduct research on the current state of the issue and potential solutions: There are already some webapps but most of them are hard to read.

Establish a timeline and determine the type and amount of resources required: the project is planned from 8.10.2019 – 3.7.2020. We don’t have any resources or costs.

#Project Summary:	
We are doing this project, because we think that a recipe website could be very helpful. The website will contain a library where you can find and post recipes. The website will be done by Philipp Kerschbaum and Michael Tran. We can work from home and school. The project will be done until 3.7.2020. It will cost nothing.
